TI  - The endless battle between phages and CRISPR-Cas systems in Streptococcus 
      thermophilus.
PG  - 397-402

AB  - This review describes the contribution of basic research on phage-bacteria 
      interactions to the understanding of CRISPR-Cas systems and their various 
      applications. It focuses on the natural function of CRISPR-Cas systems as adaptive 
      defense mechanisms against mobile genetic elements such as bacteriophage genomes and 
      plasmids. Some of the advances in the characterization of the type II-A CRISPR-Cas 
      system of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus pyogenes led to the 
      development of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technology. We mostly discuss the 3 
      stages of the CRISPR-Cas system in S. thermophilus, namely the adaptation stage, 
      which is unique to this resistance mechanism; the CRISPR RNA biogenesis; and the 
      DNA-cutting activity in the interference stage to protect bacteria against phages. 
      Finally, we look into applications of CRISPR-Cas in microbiology, including 
      overcoming limitations in genome editing.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful tool to edit the genome of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. 
      Here, we design a simple and robust method to knockout multiple gene families based 
      on the construction of plasmids enabling the simultaneous expression of several 
      sgRNAs. We exemplify the potency of this approach by targeting the 
      well-characterized acyl-CoA oxidase family (POX) and the uncharacterized SPS19 
      family. We establish a correlation between the high lethality observed upon editing 
      multiple loci and chromosomal translocations resulting from the simultaneous 
      generation of several double-strand breaks (DSBs) and develop multiplex gene editing 
      strategies. Using homologous directed recombination to reduce chromosomal 
      translocations, we demonstrated that simultaneous editing of four genes can be 
      achieved and constructed a strain carrying a sextuple deletion of POX genes. We 
      explore an "excision approach" by simultaneously performing two DSBs in genes and 
      reached 73 to 100% editing efficiency in double disruptions and 41.7% in a triple 
      disruption. This work led to identifying SPS193 as a gene encoding a 2-4 dienoyl-CoA 
      reductase, demonstrating the potential of this method to accelerate knowledge on 
      gene function in expanded gene families.

TI  - Peptide/Cas9 nanostructures for ribonucleoprotein cell membrane transport and gene 
      edition.
PG  - 7923-7931
LID - 10.1039/c7sc03918b [doi]
AB  - The discovery of RNA guided endonucleases has emerged as one of the most important 
      tools for gene edition and biotechnology. The selectivity and simplicity of the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 strategy allows the straightforward targeting and editing of particular 
      loci in the cell genome without the requirement of protein engineering. However, the 
      transfection of plasmids encoding the Cas9 and the guide RNA could lead to undesired 
      permanent recombination and immunogenic responses. Therefore, the direct delivery of 
      transient Cas9 ribonucleoprotein constitutes an advantageous strategy for gene 
      edition and other potential therapeutic applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The 
      covalent fusion of Cas9 with penetrating peptides requires multiple incubation steps 
      with the target cells to achieve efficient levels of gene edition. These and other 
      recent reports suggested that covalent conjugation of the anionic Cas9 
      ribonucleoprotein to cationic peptides would be associated with a hindered nuclease 
      activity due to undesired electrostatic interactions. We here report a 
      supramolecular strategy for the direct delivery of Cas9 by an amphiphilic 
      penetrating peptide that was prepared by a hydrazone bond formation between a 
      cationic peptide scaffold and a hydrophobic aldehyde tail. The peptide/protein 
      non-covalent nanoparticles performed with similar efficiency and less toxicity than 
      one of the best methods described to date. To the best of our knowledge this report 
      constitutes the first supramolecular strategy for the direct delivery of Cas9 using 
      a penetrating peptide vehicle. The results reported here confirmed that peptide 
      amphiphilic vectors can deliver Cas9 in a single incubation step, with good 
      efficiency and low toxicity. This work will encourage the search and development of 
      conceptually new synthetic systems for transitory endonucleases direct delivery.

AB  - The application of new technologies for gene editing in horses may allow the 
      generation of improved sportive individuals. Here, we aimed to knock out the 
      myostatin gene (MSTN), a negative regulator of muscle mass development, using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 and to generate edited embryos for the first time in horses. We 
      nucleofected horse fetal fibroblasts with 1, 2 or 5 µg of 2 different gRNA/Cas9 
      plasmids targeting the first exon of MSTN. We observed that increasing plasmid 
      concentrations improved mutation efficiency. The average efficiency was 63.6% for 
      gRNA1 (14/22 edited clonal cell lines) and 96.2% for gRNA2 (25/26 edited clonal cell 
      lines). Three clonal cell lines were chosen for embryo generation by somatic cell 
      nuclear transfer: one with a monoallelic edition, one with biallelic heterozygous 
      editions and one with a biallelic homozygous edition, which rendered edited 
      blastocysts in each case. Both MSTN editions and off-targets were analyzed in the 
      embryos. In conclusion, CRISPR/Cas9 proved an efficient method to edit the horse 
      genome in a dose dependent manner with high specificity. Adapting this technology 
      sport advantageous alleles could be generated, and a precision breeding program 
      could be developed.

TI  - Universal highly efficient conditional knockout system in Leishmania, with a focus 
      on untranscribed region preservation.
PG  - e13159
LID - 10.1111/cmi.13159 [doi]
AB  - Trypanosomatids are divergent eukaryotes of high medical and economical relevance. 
      Their biology exhibits original features that remain poorly understood; 
      particularly, Leishmania is known for its high degree of genomic plasticity that 
      makes genomic manipulation challenging. CRISPR-Cas9 has been applied successfully to 
      these parasites providing a robust tool to study non-essential gene functions. Here, 
      we have developed a versatile inducible system combining Di-Cre recombinase and 
      CRISPR-Cas9 advantages. Cas9 is used to integrate the LoxP sequences, and the 
      Cre-recombinase catalyses the recombination between LoxP sites, thereby excising the 
      target gene. We used a Leishmania mexicana cell line expressing Di-Cre, Cas9, and T7 
      polymerase and then transfected donor DNAs and single guide RNAs as polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) products. Because the location of LoxP sequences in the genomic DNA 
      can interfere with the function and localisation of certain proteins of interest, we 
      proposed to target the least transcribed regions upstream and/or downstream the gene 
      of interest. To do so, we developed "universal" template plasmids for donor DNA 
      cassettes with or without a tag, where LoxP sequences may be located either 
      immediately upstream the ATG and downstream the stop codon of the gene of interest, 
      or in the least transcribed areas of intergenic regions. Our methodology is fast, 
      PCR-based (molecular cloning-free), highly efficient, versatile, and able to 
      overcome the problems posed by genomic plasticity in Leishmania.

AB  - The recently developed engineered nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases, 
      transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) 9, provide new 
      opportunities for gene editing in a straightforward manner. However, few reports are 
      available regarding CRISPR application and efficiency in cattle. Here, the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 system was used with the aim of inducing knockout and knock-in alleles 
      of the bovine PRNP gene, responsible for mad cow disease, both in bovine fetal 
      fibroblasts and in IVF embryos. Five single-guide RNAs were designed to target 
      875 bp of PRNP exon 3, and all five were codelivered with Cas9. The feasibility of 
      inducing homologous recombination (HR) was evaluated with a reporter vector carrying 
      EGFP flanked by 1 kbp PRNP regions (pHRegfp). For somatic cells, plasmids coding for 
      Cas9 and for each of the five single-guide RNAs (pCMVCas9 and pSPgRNAs) were 
      transfected under two different conditions (1X and 2X). For IVF zygotes, cytoplasmic 
      injection was conducted with either plasmids or mRNA. For plasmid injection groups, 
      1 pg pCMVCas9 + 0.1 pg of each pSPgRNA (DNA2X) was used per zygote. In the case of 
      RNA, two amounts (RNA1X and RNA2X) were compared. To assess the occurrence of HR, a 
      group additionally cotransfected or coinjected with pHRegfp plasmid was included. 
      Somatic cell lysates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and surveyor assay. 
      In the case of embryos, the in vitro development and the genotype of blastocysts 
      were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. In somatic cells, 2X 
      transfection resulted in indels and large deletions of the targeted PRNP region. 
      Regarding embryo injection, higher blastocyst rates were obtained for RNA injected 
      groups (46/103 [44.6%] and 55/116 [47.4%] for RNA1X and RNA2X) than for the DNA2X 
      group (26/140 [18.6%], P < 0.05). In 46% (26/56) of the total sequenced blastocysts, 
      specific gene editing was detected. The total number of genetic modifications (29) 
      was higher than the total number of gene-edited embryos, as three blastocysts from 
      the group RNA2X reported more than one type of modification. The modifications 
      included indels (10/56; 17.9%) and large deletions (19/56; 33.9%). Moreover, it was 
      possible to detect HR in 1/8 (12.5%) embryos treated with RNA2X. These results 
      report that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be applied for site-specific edition of the 
      bovine genome, which could have a great impact on the development of large animals 
      resistant to important zoonotic diseases.

TI  - Engineering multiple genomic deletions in Gram-negative bacteria: analysis of the 
      multi-resistant antibiotic profile of Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
PG  - 2702-16

AB  - The genome of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 has been erased of 
      various determinants of resistance to antibiotics encoded in its extant chromosome. 
      To this end, we employed a coherent genetic platform that allowed the precise 
      deletion of multiple genomic segments in a large variety of Gram-negative bacteria 
      including (but not limited to) P. putida. The method is based on the obligatory 
      recombination between free-ended homologous DNA sequences that are released as 
      linear fragments generated upon the cleavage of the chromosome with unique I-SceI 
      sites, added to the segment of interest by the vector system. Despite the potential 
      for a SOS response brought about by the appearance of double stranded DNA breaks 
      during the process, fluctuation experiments revealed that the procedure did not 
      increase mutation rates - perhaps due to the protection exerted by I-SceI bound to 
      the otherwise naked DNA termini. With this tool in hand we made sequential deletions 
      of genes mexC, mexE, ttgA and ampC in the genome of the target bacterium, 
      orthologues of which are known to determine various degrees of antibiotic resistance 
      in diverse microorganisms. Inspection of the corresponding phenotypes demonstrated 
      that the efflux pump encoded by ttgA sufficed to endow P. putida with a high-level 
      of tolerance to β-lactams, chloramphenicol and quinolones, but had little effect on, 
      e.g. aminoglycosides. Analysis of the mutants revealed also a considerable diversity 
      in the manifestation of the resistance phenotype within the population and suggested 
      a degree of synergism between different pumps. The directed edition of the P. putida 
      chromosome shown here not only enhances the amenability of this bacterium to deep 
      genomic engineering, but also validates the corresponding approach for similar 
      handlings of a large variety of Gram-negative microorganisms.
